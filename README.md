# Temp-logger
Making a temperature logger and seeing if I can add my own twist to it 

Main goal is to build a system that:
  - reliably measures the temperature
  - give time stamps for the live readings
  - clean csv over Serial
  - learning sensor faults
  - practising c++ and becoming more fluent
